- When you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY Coding Principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file
- Solves the problem of code files being too lengthy and complex
- Can be reused across several programs
- Python comes with a lot of modules as well (Python Standard Library)
